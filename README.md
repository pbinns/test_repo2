# test_repo

Modify this test repo to see what effect a push command will have on the existing
repo on Github

Let's also check out tables in markdown:

variable name  |  variable units  | variable description
---------------|------------------|---------------------
VX             | ft/sec           | mean velocity in X axis
VY             | ft/sec           | mean velocity in Y axis
etc.           | ft/sec^2         | table filler

Check out also the two versions for specifying a link, 

* using plaintext:  www.rstudio.com

* as illustrated in RStudio's sample markdown file <www.rstudio.com>  or

* as specified in the Markdown Reference Manual, [link](www.rstudio.com).
